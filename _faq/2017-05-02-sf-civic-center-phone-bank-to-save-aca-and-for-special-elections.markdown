We’re making calls to Save ACA and for upcoming federal special elections around the country. Our success in stopping the repeal of ACA (so far), as well as Jon Ossoff's first-place win in the Georgia primary and James Thompson's better-than-expected finish in Kansas, have shown how effective phone banks can be in helping to motivate Democratic voters and getting them to the polls.
BRING a charged cell phone AND a laptop, iPad, or tablet and we'll show you the rest.
We’re open from 1–5pm Saturday; feel free to stop by at whatever time works best for you.
If you don't have a laptop or tablet, please contact info@demaction.us and we may have a spare you can use. (We can always use more tablets and laptops, so if you have a spare one you'd be willing to share, please bring it with you.)
The location is just half a block from Civic Center BART, and several different Muni lines stop nearby at 9th and Market. Parking is available at the Civic Center Garage and bike parking is available inside the building.
